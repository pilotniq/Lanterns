=========================================
__Copyright (C) 2011 Erland Lewin, Mac Ryan__


Description
-----------
Lanterns is the program that runs the core of a word clock. It has 
been written in AVR assembly language, for the ATmega168 ÂµC, using 
__avr-as__ as assembler.

The repo contains different config_xxx.h files that respond to the
specific needs of the two different clocks built by the two 
maintainers.
